### General Disclaimer

This software is provided "as is" without any express or implied warranties. The developers and contributors of this project make no representations or warranties regarding the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or suitability of the software.

### AI-Generated Content

**Important Notes About AI Usage:**

1. **Content Accuracy**: AI-generated summaries (TL;DR, motivation, methods, results, conclusions) are produced by large language models (LLMs) and may contain errors, inaccuracies, or misunderstandings of the original research papers. Users should:
   - Always verify AI-generated content against the original papers
   - Not rely solely on AI summaries for critical research decisions
   - Use AI summaries only as a preliminary screening tool

2. **Academic Integrity**: Users are responsible for:
   - Properly citing original research papers, not AI-generated summaries
   - Ensuring compliance with institutional policies regarding AI usage
   - Verifying information before using it in academic work or publications

3. **API Costs**: Users are responsible for:
   - All costs incurred from using third-party AI services (OpenAI, DeepSeek, etc.)
   - Monitoring and managing API usage and billing
   - Ensuring compliance with API provider terms of service

### Data Privacy and Security

1. **API Data Transmission**: When using cloud AI providers, paper abstracts and metadata are transmitted to third-party services. Users should:
   - Review AI providers' privacy policies and data handling practices
   - Be aware that sensitive or unpublished research data may be exposed
   - Consider using local LLM deployments (e.g., Ollama) for sensitive content

2. **Zotero Integration**: This software accesses your Zotero library via API. Please ensure:
   - Keep your Zotero API key secure and do not share it
   - Comply with any institutional policies regarding cloud-based reference management

### Legal and Copyright Considerations

1. **Copyright Compliance**: Users must:
   - Respect copyright laws and terms of service of content providers (arXiv, Nature, etc.)
   - Ensure legal access to scraped papers and abstracts
   - Not use this tool for unauthorized distribution of copyrighted materials

2. **Research Ethics**: Users should:
   - Follow research and publication ethics guidelines in their field
   - Not use this tool to facilitate plagiarism or academic misconduct
   - Respect publisher policies regarding automated content access

3. **API Terms of Service**: Users must:
   - Comply with arXiv's API usage policies and rate limits
   - Respect Nature and other publishers' API terms of service
   - Legally obtain necessary API keys and use them responsibly

### Jurisdiction-Specific Statements

**Important**: If your jurisdiction has specific regulations regarding:
- Academic data processing and storage
- AI-generated content usage and disclosure
- Automated access to research databases
- Cross-border data transfers

You are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
